1. MSSubClass - This feature categorizes houses based on their structure, age, and design:
- The first number (1 or 2) typically indicates the number of stories
- The year 1946 is a key dividing point, separating older and newer constructions
- PUD stands for Planned Unit Development, which are special residential areas with their own development plans

2. LotFrontage - This is the length (in feet) of the street side of the lot. It's important because:
- Larger frontage often means more valuable property
- It affects curb appeal and access to the property
- Can influence the overall lot size and house placement options

3. LotArea - The total area of the lot in square feet:
- Combines depth and width of the property
- Direct indicator of property size
- Important factor in property value

4. Street - Describes the type of road access:
- Paved streets generally indicate better infrastructure
- Gravel roads might suggest more rural or less developed areas
- Can affect property value and accessibility

5. Alley - Describes secondary access to the property:
- Important for parking access
- Can affect property value
- NA means no alley access, which is common

6. LandContour - Describes the flatness of the property:
- Lvl (Level) - Flat land, typically most desirable
- Bnk (Banked) - Property sits above street level
- HLS (Hillside) - Sloped from side to side
- Low - Property sits below street level

7. LotConfig - Describes how the lot is situated:
- Inside lots are surrounded by other properties
- Corner lots have street exposure on two sides
- CulDSac lots are often more desirable due to less traffic
- FR2/FR3 lots have multiple street exposures

8. LandSlope - Indicates the slope severity of the property:
- Can affect construction costs
- Influences drainage and potential foundation issues
- More severe slopes might require special building considerations

9. BldgType - Describes the type of dwelling structure:
- Distinguishes between single-family homes, duplexes, and townhouses
- Important for understanding the property type and potential usage
- Can significantly affect property value

10. MasVnrType - Describes the masonry veneer (decorative exterior layer):
- Brick and stone veneers often indicate higher quality construction
- Can affect both aesthetics and maintenance requirements
- Important for overall exterior quality assessment

11. BsmtExposure - Indicates how much of the basement walls are above ground:
- Better exposure usually means more natural light
- Affects potential for basement living space
- Can influence basement finishing options and value

12. Electrical - Describes the electrical system type:
- SBrkr (Standard Circuit Breakers) is the modern standard
- Fuse systems (FuseA, FuseF, FuseP) are older and might need updating
- Important for safety and potential upgrade costs

13. LowQualFinSF - Areas of low-quality finishing:
- Indicates spaces with substandard finish work
- Might suggest need for renovation
- Can negatively impact property value

14. BsmtHalfBath - A half bathroom (toilet and sink, no shower/bath) in the basement:
- Adds convenience for basement spaces
- Can add value if basement is finished
- Indicates more developed basement space

15. WoodDeckSF - Area of wood deck in square feet:
- Outdoor living space
- Adds to overall property value
- Requires maintenance consideration

16. OpenPorchSF - Area of open porch in square feet:
- Provides covered outdoor space
- Adds curb appeal
- Different from enclosed porches in terms of usability

17. SaleType - How the property was sold:
- Indicates financing method used
- Can suggest property condition or circumstances of sale
- Important for understanding sale context

18. SaleCondition - Special circumstances of sale:
- Can indicate potential bargains (foreclosures)
- Helps understand if sale price was influenced by special circumstances
- Important for analyzing whether the sale price was market-representative


1. Duplex:
- A duplex is a single building divided into two separate living units/homes
- Usually has separate entrances for each unit
- Can be side-by-side or one unit above the other
- Different from a single-family home converted into two units (which would be "2FmCon" in this dataset)

2. LotFrontage:
- It's not the distance from front door to curb
- It's the width of the lot along the street side
- For example, if your lot is rectangular and faces the street, LotFrontage is how wide your property is along that street
- This measurement is important because wider lots often allow for larger houses or more flexibility in house placement

3. FR2 and FR3 (Frontage):
- FR2: The lot has streets on two sides (like a corner lot but with more street exposure)
- FR3: The lot has streets on three sides
- These lots offer:
  - More access points
  - Better natural light
  - More visibility
  - Sometimes more parking options
  - But also less privacy than interior lots

4. Masonry:
- Masonry refers to building with materials like brick, stone, or concrete blocks
- Masonry veneer is a non-structural outer layer:
  - It's decorative and protective
  - Common materials are brick face, stone, or concrete
  - Adds to curb appeal and weather protection
  - Usually indicates higher quality construction

5. Finishing options (particularly for basements):
- GLQ: Good Living Quarters (high quality, fully finished)
- ALQ: Average Living Quarters (comfortable but not premium)
- BLQ: Below Average Living Quarters (functional but basic)
- Rec: Recreation room quality
- LwQ: Low quality finishing
- Unf: Unfinished

6. Low-quality finishing (LowQualFinSF):
- Areas finished with minimal cost materials
- May include:
  - Cheap paneling instead of drywall
  - Basic concrete floors instead of proper flooring
  - Minimal insulation
  - Poor lighting
  - Rough or incomplete finishing work
  - Non-standard room layouts or configurations
- Often indicates DIY work or budget constraints
- Might need renovation or upgrading
- Generally detracts from home value
