current situation #1:
    So I started Kaggle House Prices project. The goal is to predict house price based on 79 variables.
    I've loaded data, done some cleaning.
    Here are dimensions of datasets:
    Train data: (1460, 81)
    Test data: (1459, 80)
    There are some missing values in both train and test datasets:
        train df NA counts
        LotFrontage    259
        MasVnrArea       8
        Electrical       1
        GarageYrBlt     81

        test df NA counts
        MSZoning          4
        LotFrontage     227
        Utilities         2
        Exterior1st       1
        Exterior2nd       1
        MasVnrArea       15
        BsmtFinSF1        1
        BsmtFinSF2        1
        BsmtUnfSF         1
        TotalBsmtSF       1
        BsmtFullBath      2
        BsmtHalfBath      2
        KitchenQual       1
        Functional        2
        GarageYrBlt      78
        GarageCars        1
        GarageArea        1
        SaleType          1

    For now the main concern is the missing of LotFrontage values.
    LotFrontage means linear feet of street connected to property.
    For some reason there are 16% - 18% of LotFrontage values which are missing.

current situation #2:
    Exploring single missing Electrical value, I've found that the observation has normal other predictors.
    Utilities is AllPub, which means the house has normal electrical circuit. It was built in 2006,
    which suggests it should has modern electrical circuits. Overall quality is normal, not poor. So I think
    the value is missing completely at random, and have imputed it with the mode - SBrkr.

    I've also performed special NA filling for MasVnrType and MasVnrArea, since MasVnrType has special
    NA value - None

current situation #3:
    I've created new has_garage and lot_frontage_missing features. I've filled missing GarageYrBlt with YearBuilt.
    In the test set there are two values with GarageType Detchd but no GarageYrBlt. One of them contains only GarageCars and
    GarageArea values. Other contains no info, so I make its GarageType NA. After completing filling of NA for test set
    I should validate if some NA values which are categorical now or 0 should be imputed. Don't forget!

    Here is Na info after cleaning so far:
        train df NA counts
        LotFrontage    259

        test df NA counts
        MSZoning         4
        LotFrontage    227
        Utilities        2
        Exterior1st      1
        Exterior2nd      1
        KitchenQual      1
        Functional       2
        SaleType         1

    All of these variables must be imputed.

current situation #4:
    I've performed consistency check for variables which I've cleaned. Here is the result:
        Check if newly created has_garage feature is inconsistent with actual garage type
            train df: 0
            test df: 0

        Check if some garage features are missing for non missing garage type:
            train df: 0
            test df: 1
                Id                         2127
                GarageType               Detchd
                GarageYrBlt              1910.0
                GarageFinish                 NA
                GarageCars                  1.0
                GarageArea                360.0
                GarageQual                   NA
                GarageCond                   NA

        Check if there are garages with suspicious garage area to car places ratio:
            train df: 55
            test df: 51

        Check if some basement features missing for non-missing basement type:
            train df: 1
                Id                                       949
                BsmtQual                                  Gd
                BsmtCond                                  TA
                BsmtExposure                              NA
                BsmtFinType1                             Unf
                BsmtFinSF1                                 0
                BsmtFinType2                             Unf
                BsmtFinSF2                                 0
                BsmtUnfSF                                936
                TotalBsmtSF                              936

            test df: 7

        Check if some basements have inconsistent second finished area:
            train df: 1257
            test df: 1237

        Check if some basement areas have finished area + unfinished area not equal to total basement area:
            train df: 0
            test df: 0

        Check if some housed have inconsistent masonry veneer area if have the exterior:
            train df: 7
            test df: 4

    Next I want to deal with basement second finished area, garage area, masonry veneer area and garage and basement
    features in that order.

current situation #5:
    I've investigated inconsistencies with basement second finished area:
        train_df_bfa2 = train_df_check[~train_df_check["has_consistent_second_finished_area"]]
        print(train_df_bfa2["BsmtFinType2"].value_counts())
        # Unf    1256
        # NA        1
        # GLQ       0
        # BLQ       0
        # ALQ       0
        # LwQ       0
        # Rec       0

    It turned out that a lot of houses which have Unfinished second area have 0 finished second area.
    So instead of changing the data I've changed consistency criterion. After the change there is 1 inconsistent observation
    in the train set and 2 in the test set:
        train df:
            Id                                       333
            BsmtQual                                  Gd
            BsmtCond                                  TA
            BsmtExposure                              No
            BsmtFinType1                             GLQ
            BsmtFinSF1                              1124
            BsmtFinType2                              NA <- have to do something about it
            BsmtFinSF2                               479
            BsmtUnfSF                               1603
            TotalBsmtSF                             3206

        test df:
            Id                                      1471     2285
            BsmtQual                                  Gd       Gd
            BsmtCond                                  TA       TA
            BsmtExposure                              No       No
            BsmtFinType1                             GLQ      GLQ
            BsmtFinSF1                            1051.0    632.0
            BsmtFinType2                             BLQ      Unf
            BsmtFinSF2                               0.0      6.0
            BsmtUnfSF                              354.0    423.0
            TotalBsmtSF                           1405.0   1061.0

    Test set entries seem ok, so I decided to leave them alone. The train set entry must be imputed with new BsmtFinType2.

Current situation #6:
    I've explored "suspicious" garages. There are 11 too-small-area garages and 44 too-big-area garages in the train set. 
    Exploration showed that all of them are fairly normal houses, with their garage sizes can be explained with other features.
    In the test set proportion of such homes is almost the same, so I decided not to explore it. Maybe it's a mistake.
    There are non-None MasVnrType houses with 0 MasVnrArea and houses with None MasVnrType houses with reasonable MasVnrArea. 
    First ones I've made as None MasVnrType, and second ones I've imputed with BrkFace in MasVnrType.
