current situation #1:
    So I started Kaggle House Prices project. The goal is to predict house price based on 79 variables.
    I've loaded data, done some cleaning.
    Here are dimensions of datasets:
    Train data: (1460, 81)
    Test data: (1459, 80)
    There are some missing values in both train and test datasets:
        train df NA counts
        LotFrontage    259
        MasVnrArea       8
        Electrical       1
        GarageYrBlt     81

        test df NA counts
        MSZoning          4
        LotFrontage     227
        Utilities         2
        Exterior1st       1
        Exterior2nd       1
        MasVnrArea       15
        BsmtFinSF1        1
        BsmtFinSF2        1
        BsmtUnfSF         1
        TotalBsmtSF       1
        BsmtFullBath      2
        BsmtHalfBath      2
        KitchenQual       1
        Functional        2
        GarageYrBlt      78
        GarageCars        1
        GarageArea        1
        SaleType          1

    For now the main concern is the missing of LotFrontage values.
    LotFrontage means linear feet of street connected to property.
    For some reason there are 16% - 18% of LotFrontage values which are missing.

current situation #2:
    Exploring single missing Electrical value, I've found that the observation has normal other predictors.
    Utilities is AllPub, which means the house has normal electrical circuit. It was built in 2006,
    which suggests it should has modern electrical circuits. Overall quality is normal, not poor. So I think
    the value is missing completely at random, and have imputed it with the mode - SBrkr.

    I've also performed special NA filling for MasVnrType and MasVnrArea, since MasVnrType has special
    NA value - None

current situation #3:
    I've created new has_garage and lot_frontage_missing features. I've filled missing GarageYrBlt with YearBuilt.
    In the test set there are two values with GarageType Detchd but no GarageYrBlt. One of them contains only GarageCars and
    GarageArea values. Other contains no info, so I make its GarageType NA. After completing filling of NA for test set
    I should validate if some NA values which are categorical now or 0 should be imputed. Don't forget!

    Here is Na info after cleaning so far:
        train df NA counts
        LotFrontage    259

        test df NA counts
        MSZoning         4
        LotFrontage    227
        Utilities        2
        Exterior1st      1
        Exterior2nd      1
        KitchenQual      1
        Functional       2
        SaleType         1

    All of these variables must be imputed.

current situation #4:
    I've performed consistency check for variables which I've cleaned. Here is the result:
        Check if newly created has_garage feature is inconsistent with actual garage type
            train df: 0
            test df: 0

        Check if some garage features are missing for non missing garage type:
            train df: 0
            test df: 1
                Id                         2127
                GarageType               Detchd
                GarageYrBlt              1910.0
                GarageFinish                 NA
                GarageCars                  1.0
                GarageArea                360.0
                GarageQual                   NA
                GarageCond                   NA

        Check if there are garages with suspicious garage area to car places ratio:
            train df: 55
            test df: 51

        Check if some basement features missing for non-missing basement type:
            train df: 1
                Id                                       949
                BsmtQual                                  Gd
                BsmtCond                                  TA
                BsmtExposure                              NA
                BsmtFinType1                             Unf
                BsmtFinSF1                                 0
                BsmtFinType2                             Unf
                BsmtFinSF2                                 0
                BsmtUnfSF                                936
                TotalBsmtSF                              936

            test df: 7

        Check if some basements have inconsistent second finished area:
            train df: 1257
            test df: 1237

        Check if some basement areas have finished area + unfinished area not equal to total basement area:
            train df: 0
            test df: 0

        Check if some housed have inconsistent masonry veneer area if have the exterior:
            train df: 7
            test df: 4

    Next I want to deal with basement second finished area, garage area, masonry veneer area and garage and basement
    features in that order.

current situation #5:
    I've investigated inconsistencies with basement second finished area:
        train_df_bfa2 = train_df_check[~train_df_check["has_consistent_second_finished_area"]]
        print(train_df_bfa2["BsmtFinType2"].value_counts())
        # Unf    1256
        # NA        1
        # GLQ       0
        # BLQ       0
        # ALQ       0
        # LwQ       0
        # Rec       0

    It turned out that a lot of houses which have Unfinished second area have 0 finished second area.
    So instead of changing the data I've changed consistency criterion. After the change there is 1 inconsistent observation
    in the train set and 2 in the test set:
        train df:
            Id                                       333
            BsmtQual                                  Gd

            BsmtFinSF1                              1124
            BsmtFinType2                              NA <- have to do something about it
            BsmtFinSF2                               479
            BsmtUnfSF                               1603
            TotalBsmtSF                             3206

        test df:

            BsmtExposure                              No       No
            BsmtFinType1                             GLQ      GLQ
            BsmtFinSF1                            1051.0    632.0
            BsmtFinType2                             BLQ      Unf
            BsmtFinSF2                               0.0      6.0
            BsmtUnfSF                              354.0    423.0
            TotalBsmtSF                           1405.0   1061.0

    Test set entries seem ok, so I decided to leave them alone. The train set entry must be imputed with new BsmtFinType2.

Current situation #6:
    I've explored "suspicious" garages. There are 11 too-small-area garages and 44 too-big-area garages in the train set. 
    Exploration showed that all of them are fairly normal houses, with their garage sizes can be explained with other features.
    In the test set proportion of such homes is almost the same, so I decided not to explore it. Maybe it's a mistake.
    There are non-None MasVnrType houses with 0 MasVnrArea and houses with None MasVnrType houses with reasonable MasVnrArea. 
    First ones I've made as None MasVnrType, and second ones I've imputed with BrkFace in MasVnrType.

Current situation #7:
    I've fixed single inconsistent garage in the test set, one with ID 2127. I've imputed missing features based on modes of 
    entries of GarageType vs GarageFinish, GarageType vs GarageQual and GarageQual vs OverallQual tables. Now I need to clean up
    basement features and then proceed with imputation of smaller problems.

Current situation #8:
    I've imputed and cleaned basement and garage features, with group medians
    based on particular observations data, since there were only few of them.
    Also some basement features were actually consistent, and problem was in my criterion.
    Now I need to impute test set variables.

Current situation #9:
    I've tried to investigate missingness of MSZoning in the test set, Ids 1916, 2217,	2251 and 2905. I've tried to fit CatBoost and RF and Log Reg but there is 
    class imbalance in the response so I haven't figured out much. Instead I've just checked conditional probabilities of
    MSZoning given "Neighborhood", "BldgType", "LotArea_Cat", "MSSubClass" and "Condition1". LotArea_Cat is LotArea cut into quintiles, to make it categorical.
    Here is the summary:
              Neighborhood_IDOTRR  Neighborhood_Mitchel  BldgType_1Fam  LotArea_Cat_Very Large  MSSubClass_30  MSSubClass_20  MSSubClass_70  Condition1_Norm  Condition1_Artery

    I believe Neighborhood is main predictor of zone type, so I will use neighborhood based predictions for the missing data,
    except Id=2217, where MSSubClass-based MSZoning probability is ~95% RL.

Current situation #10:
    I've tried to investigate missing Utilities values. There are 2 such houses in the test set, Ids 1916 and 1946. So these houses are very old and
    in poor condition. They have old but available electric circuits and gas heating. Therefore I'll put NoSeWa into NA places.

    I've checked missing Functional values, two houses with Ids 2217 and 2474. Again, because of class imabalance, it's hard to perform meaningful statisical tests.
    And again I've used conditional probabilities of Functional given "OverallCond", "OverallQual" and "SaleCondition":
                        OverallCond_5  OverallCond_1  OverallQual_1  OverallQual_4  SaleCondition_Abnorml
            Functional

    I've imputed 2 missing values based on this data. I know it's not very smart to use this approach, but I can't get enough
    domain knowledge. Maybe I'm not smart enough to see relationships in the data. My main predictor is OverallCond. It's 1
    for 2474, so I've used Maj1 Functional for it, which means serious damage, but not completely devastated. For 2217 OverallCond
    is 5, which suggests that functionality of the house is typical (Typ).

Current situation #11:
    I've investigated missing Exterior1st and Excterior2nd. The fact that both Exterior1st and Excterior2nd are missing
    in the same house bothers me. at the same moment it's weird to have NAs in the places since there are categories
    like 'Other' which cover any exterior type. Also if the exterior was severely damaged its ExterCond would be Po. 
    So i think it's a data entry error.
    I decided to find all houses built OR remodeled within 5 years of the house,
    from the same neighborhood, and with same exterior quality and condition,
    and take their modes for Exterior1st and Exterior2nd to impute missing values.
    Here is the result:
        Exterior1st  Exterior2nd
        VinylSd           12           12
        MetalSd            7            7
        Wd Sdng            4            4
        WdShing            3            0
        Stucco             1            1
        Plywood            1            1
        HdBoard            1            1
        Wd Shng            0            3
        Stone              0            0
        Other              0            0
        AsbShng            0            0
        AsphShn            0            0
        CmentBd            0            0
        CemntBd            0            0
        CBlock             0            0
        BrkFace            0            0
        BrkComm            0            0
        Brk Cmn            0            0
        ImStucc            0            0

    So VinylSd was chosen for both exterior types

Current situation #12:
    I've explored house in the test set with missing KitchenQual. It is in poor condition and medium 
    quality with moderate deductions. it has kitchen since KitchenAbvGr is 1. I've crosstabed 
    KitchenQual vs OverallQual, OverallCond and Functional. all of the tables suggest TA for KitchenQual.
    So I decided to impute missing KitchenQual with TA.

    I've explored house in the test which has missing SaleType. I've crosstabed SaleType against 
    SaleCondition and YrSold. both tables have WD as most common SaleType for characteristics of this house. 
    The house is average with no unusual features. So I will use WD as imputation value.

    Now I finnally can start to clean LotFrontage.

Current situation #13:
    Restoring LotFrontage. log(LotFrontage) and log(LotArea) has clear relationship, but with unequal 
    variances. Through ANOVA, I've found out that BldgType and Neighborhood shown both significant 
    relationships with LotFrontage and variance explanation. LotShape and LotConfig have significant 
    relationships with LotFrontage. I've performed missingness patterns analysis. LotFrontage is missing
    not in random. I've performed Chi-squared tests for independence of LotFrontage and categorical 
    variables. Neighborhood and lot configuration impact missingness. I've created RF based imputer
    which predicts log(LotFrontage) with log(LotArea),  BldgType, Neighborhood, LotShape, LotConfig, 
    LandContour, YearBuilt and OverallQual. The model has RMSE of 1.1827 feet, which is not bad. I've
    used it to impute missing LotFrontage data.
