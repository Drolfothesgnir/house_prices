current situation #1:
    So I started Kaggle House Prices project. The goal is to predict house price based on 79 variables.
    I've loaded data, done some cleaning.
    Here are dimensions of datasets:
    Train data: (1460, 81)
    Test data: (1459, 80)
    There are some missing values in both train and test datasets:
        train df NA counts
        LotFrontage    259
        MasVnrArea       8
        Electrical       1
        GarageYrBlt     81

        test df NA counts
        MSZoning          4
        LotFrontage     227
        Utilities         2
        Exterior1st       1
        Exterior2nd       1

        BsmtFinSF1        1
        BsmtFinSF2        1
        BsmtUnfSF         1
        TotalBsmtSF       1
        BsmtFullBath      2
        BsmtHalfBath      2

        Functional        2
        GarageYrBlt      78
        GarageCars        1
        GarageArea        1
        SaleType          1

    For now the main concern is the missing of LotFrontage values.
    LotFrontage means linear feet of street connected to property.
    For some reason there are 16% - 18% of LotFrontage values which are missing.
