current situation #1:
    So I started Kaggle House Prices project. The goal is to predict house price based on 79 variables.
    I've loaded data, done some cleaning.
    Here are dimensions of datasets:
    Train data: (1460, 81)
    Test data: (1459, 80)
    There are some missing values in both train and test datasets:
        train df NA counts
        LotFrontage    259
        MasVnrArea       8
        Electrical       1
        GarageYrBlt     81

        test df NA counts
        MSZoning          4
        LotFrontage     227
        Utilities         2
        Exterior1st       1
        Exterior2nd       1
        MasVnrArea       15
        BsmtFinSF1        1
        BsmtFinSF2        1
        BsmtUnfSF         1
        TotalBsmtSF       1
        BsmtFullBath      2
        BsmtHalfBath      2
        KitchenQual       1
        Functional        2
        GarageYrBlt      78
        GarageCars        1
        GarageArea        1
        SaleType          1

    For now the main concern is the missing of LotFrontage values.
    LotFrontage means linear feet of street connected to property.
    For some reason there are 16% - 18% of LotFrontage values which are missing.

current situation #2:
    Exploring single missing Electrical value, I've found that the observation has normal other predictors.
    Utilities is AllPub, which means the house has normal electrical circuit. It was built in 2006,
    which suggests it should has modern electrical circuits. Overall quality is normal, not poor. So I think
    the value is missing completely at random, and have imputed it with the mode - SBrkr.

    I've also performed special NA filling for MasVnrType and MasVnrArea, since MasVnrType has special
    NA value - None

current situation #2:
    I've created new has_garage and lot_frontage_missing features. I've filled missing GarageYrBlt with YearBuilt.
    In the test set there are two values with GarageType Detchd but no GarageYrBlt. One of them contains only GarageCars and
    GarageArea values. Other contains no info, so I make its GarageType NA. After completing filling of NA for test set
    I should validate if some NA values which are categorical now or 0 should be imputed. Don't forget!
