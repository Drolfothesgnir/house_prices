1. Data import
    a) Import data with proper data types.
    b) Complete data (fill NA values with proper "NA" categories). no imputation.
2. EDA (different stages can be done simultaneously and concurrently)
    a) Understand meaning of variables
        1. Explore missing values.
        2. Create imputation strategy for every column with missing variables.
        3. Search for outliers and high-leverage points. Understand whether they are ok or not. Transform them if not.
    b) Explore domain of the problem
        1. Understand what are the main influencers of the House Price.
        2. Check our assumption about impact of different variables with visualisations and hypotheses testing.
        3. Perform cluster based analysis (since a lot of variables are correlated)
            a) Assign different variables to location clusters (Basement, Exterior, Garage, etc.)
            b) Engineer assembling features (if it makes sense)

    c) Explore overall relations in the dataset with techniques like PCA

3. Feature engineering
    a) Given all knowledge we have we create new features to simplify predictor space, remove multicollinearity and create features with more predictive power

4. Model selection and tuning
